# Hide your digits - Generate password

I was given exsisting HTML, CSS and Javascript code. The task was to add to that code to create a random password out of options which were selected by the user.

# Actions taken 

Using HTML & CSS, I created a professional looking portfolio for myself. The portfolio includes the following information:

* Header with navigational links
* An image of myself
* Personal bio of work history and personal statement
* Examples of previous projects Iâ€™ve completed, with links to the projects
* Footer with contact information which links to each contact form 


# Code Style

* HTML 
* CSS
* Javascript
