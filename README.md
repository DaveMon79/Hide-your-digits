# Hide your digits - Generate password

I was tasked with creating a random password generator. As part of the task i was supplied with functional HTML and CSS code, and partial Javascript code, which we had to build on to make the password generator functional. 

# Actions taken 

I broke the task down in steps which needed to be achieved in order to succesfully acheive the task:

* Create four different arrays to store uppercase letters, lowercase letters, number and special characters
* Create a prompt box which to take and store user information
* Make a random password out of the user information stored within variables



# Code Style

* HTML 
* CSS
* Javascript

# Difficulties

I found the whole project extremely difficult, with it being my first attempt at coding with Javascript. Whie there was endless YouTube tutorial videos to refer to, i struggled to find any examples which fit the flow of the code I had already written. 



# Success

* I was able to write a base code with working prompt boxes which store user information in variables
* While i'm still a javascript novice, i have far greater undertanding of how it works and what it can do
